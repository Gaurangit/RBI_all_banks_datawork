# RBI_all_banks_datawork

This repo contains the codes to process and merge the proprietary bank data on branch level financial outcomes from the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI).Since the data is proprietary and sensitive, I haven't uploded the data files(also data is huge, ~100+ GB). This data is merged at branch level 
with the relevant household survey data cunducted by CMIE, again proprietary data. Futher, the worked data is used for various related to 
micro and macro-economic analysis.
